I cannot connect to the platform
Network Selection:
Ensure you select the correct network (Ethereum Mainnet). You can usually switch networks in the settings option of your wallet provider.
Using Ledger (Natively or with MetaMask):
Unlock your Ledger device and select the Ethereum app.
Make sure the 'Contract Data' setting is enabled in the Ethereum app settings.
Using Coinbase:
Use the scan QR option to connect.
To access directly from the Coinbase wallet, open the browser within the app and go to app.aave.com.
Using WalletConnect:
Use the scan QR code option to connect.
Using Rabby:
Use the scan QR code option to connect.
Enable contract data on Ledger
Make sure to select the Ethereum app and enable contract data. To enable contract data:
Connect and unlock your Ledger device.
Open the Ethereum application.
Press the right button to navigate to Settings.
Then press both buttons to validate.
In the Contract data settings, press both buttons to allow contract data in transactions.
The device displays Allowed.
I cannot send transactions
Make sure you have enough ETH in your wallet to interact with the platform. You must have ETH in your wallet for the transaction costs-- without it you won't be able to interact. Depending on the network status, the cost of the transactions may vary. At least 0.05 ETH may be required to interact properly.
I do not find my position
If you used the Tokemak protocol in the past you will not find your positions on the current V2, you will need to visit he Tokemak V1 protocol. You can find an interface to interact with V1 version of the Tokemak protocol

The site does not load
The following steps may solve your problems:
If you are using Brave browser, switch to another browser to see if the issues are coming from the browser. If it is related to Brave browser some helpful actions are:
Clearing cache data and cookies for the site
Hard refresh with control + F5 (or cmd + r)
Disable brave wallet (or the wallet not being used as default, for example metamask, dapper, etc.)or other extensions that might be interfering with proper connection with the wallet
If the site still won't load after taking the steps above, you will have to use the platform in another browser.
Make sure your internet connection is working and stable
Restart the browser and try to connect again
Try to hard refresh the site with control + F5
Check if there are any updates for your browser or wallet provider. If so, update it to the latest version.
My transaction is stuck pending confirmation
In this situation make sure to not keep sending transactions, as every new transaction will be stuck pending the oldest transaction to be confirmed. You can get rid of the stuck transaction by speeding it up or cancelling it. Depending on the wallet you are using, you may have that option natively. For example, metamask or trust wallet have both the options to cancel or speed up transactions.
