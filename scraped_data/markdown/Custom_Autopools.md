Ecosystem Specific Autopools
Autopools are in essence customizable networks of automated liquidity, tokenized and made composable by their respective receipt token. This allows for a new way to combine utility with distribution. 

For instance, an autopool tailored for the XYZ DEX, featuring a custom selection of pools (e.g., correlated ETH pairs), which then distributes branded receipt tokens (e.g., xyzETH) to LPs.
Once set up, the user experience is simple: provide ETH, receive xyzETH, and the underlying liquidity remains optimally deployed, while remaining within the DEX ecosystem. 
This approach creates passive yield opportunities for users, which retain all underlying liquidity within a single ecosystem, thus promoting sticky liquidity and broadening the addressable market.

The Future of Autopools
A natural next step is to enable the permissionless creation of autopools. This feature will allow users to express individual risk preferences and allows different participants, such as risk managers, to contribute specialized skills. 

The architecture of autopools also allows to develop solutions for other problem sets requiring optimization, such as e.g. point systems.
