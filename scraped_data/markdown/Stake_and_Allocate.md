---

In order to allocate credits and activate Reward Streams, you need to stake TOKE as sTOKE using the Staking Panel:
Staking TOKE as sTOKE
Visit the Staking page
Select a Network/chain (eg. Ethereum)
Click Manage on the Staking Lateral Panel
Enter the amount of TOKE you wish to stake
Choose a staking interval
Review your boost multiplier based on the selected duration
Proceed with the staking transaction
When adding more TOKE to an existing stake, the entire staked balance will restart its lock period with the newly selected duration. This means your total staked amount (existing + new) will begin a fresh lock period. The minimum staking period for the added TOKE is the currently selected staking duration.
Allocating Your Credits
Visit the Staking page
Select a Network (e.g. Ethereum)
Click "Manage" on the Allocation Panel
Use the plus symbol (+) to add or the minus symbol (-) to change the allocation, or you can enter allocation percentages that total 100%
When allocation ready, click “Save"
You can change your allocation of credits at any time – the changes go into effect with the next snapshot. Snapshots are taken once a week.
