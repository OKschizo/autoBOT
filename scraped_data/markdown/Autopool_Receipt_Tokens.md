Enter the Auto Pools Protocol
Users gain access to autonomous LP optimization by depositing into an autopool, which use the highly composable ERC-4626 standard and can be configured with a set of destinations (pools/DEXs and lending markets for some autopools) to which assets may be deployed to. 

Assets deposited into an autopool are not subject to any lock ups or cooldown periods, meaning that users can withdraw their funds at any time.

The architecture was designed to be modular, allowing for plug-and-play integration of new assets and destinations. As a result, the system can adapt to the market swiftly by launching autopools which include e.g. a new pairings, or cater to specific ecosystems.
Composable Receipt Tokens
LPs depositing into an autopool receive reward bearing receipt tokens, which are composable across DeFi. Examples of common DeFi integrations include utilizing receipt tokens as collateral, integration into yield marketplaces to trade liquidity rates, and leverage them.
LATs are tokenized of the underlying option set of destinations
