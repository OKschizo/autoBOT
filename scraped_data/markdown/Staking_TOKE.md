Staking Fundamentals
Staking TOKE (sTOKE)
Choose a staking duration of 1-4 months (4 to 16 weeks)
Credits are generated based on amount of TOKE staked as well as lock duration (boost multiplier)
Longer staking durations provide more credits through higher boost multipliers
Adding TOKE to existing stakes restarts the staking period for your entire balance
Stakes auto-renew for the same duration unless unstaking is initiated
Unstaking must be initiated during the final week of your staking period
If unstaking has been initiated, TOKE becomes available for withdrawal once the period ends
Initiating the unstaking does not affect the rewards earned during the final week of the staking period.
Autopool Streams
Allocate credits to activate autopool streams and earn rewards
Allocate to multiple autopools simultaneously
Adjust allocations at any time without unstaking - this doesn't affect your staking period
Make sure you are staking on the correct chain for your target autopool (e.g., TOKE on Base is required to allocate credits to the baseETH Autopool)
