Introduction
The sTOKE system is Auto Finance's staking mechanism that enables active ecosystem participation. By staking TOKE, users receive credits that they can allocate to different autopools. This allocation provides access to both reward streams and, when available, additional incentives specific to each autopool.
Staking Mechanism
Staking TOKE for sTOKE
Users can stake TOKE tokens for durations between 4 and 16 weeks, during which their TOKE converts to sTOKE and generates credits that can be allocated to autopools. The staking duration directly affects the boost multiplier - longer staking periods result in higher credit generation. This system balances rewards for protocol commitment while accommodating various user preferences.

Default Allocation
Once your TOKE is staked, your credits will by default be evenly allocated to the available autopools. The default allocation will be applied to any newly staked TOKE.
Personalized Allocation
You have complete flexibility in how you want to allocate your available credits across autopools:
You can allocate to multiple autopools simultaneously.
Allocation can be modified at any time without unstaking:
Adjust your allocations across autopools at any time
Monitor and optimize your credit allocation based on performance
Your allocation of credits can be adjusted at any time, but reward calculations for the updated allocation take effect following the next snapshot. Note: when allocations are changed pre-snapshot, users will continue to earn rewards based on their previous allocation until the new snapshot goes live.
The distribution of credits is snapshotted weekly, with each snapshot determining reward distribution for the following week. This means rewards are backward-looking and are earned based on the voting snapshot at the beginning of each week.
For users looking to allocate voting credits to autopools on different chains, TOKE is required to be present on the specific chain. A seamless bridging solution is available to transfer your TOKE across networks, located in the Staking (or sTOKE) section of the UI.

Rewards
sTOKE holders who allocate their credits to autopools earn rewards from multiple sources:
Rewards generated by the specific autopools
Additional benefits from protocol-owned asset deployment
These are used to purchase TOKE to be distributed to the TOKE stakers.
The reward structure is designed to align user incentives with the protocol's long-term success, encouraging active participation in the ecosystem's growth.
