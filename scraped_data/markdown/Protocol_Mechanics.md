Design Goals
The purpose of the Autopool Protocol is to continuously rebalance assets into destinations with the best risk-return profiles, aiming to outperform any individual destination included in the autopool over the long term. Earnings are auto-compounded back into the autopool and subsequently rebalanced.

To achieve this, the autopool's rebalance logic does not merely chase the highest advertised yield but instead processes a comprehensive set of data, applies sophisticated logic, and adheres to safety constraints. 

This section will provide an accessible overview of the system's general architecture and essential features.
Components & Logic
This section provides a simplified overview of the components, their functions within the Autopool Protocol, and a summary of the rebalance logic to help users achieve a basic understanding of the autopools.
