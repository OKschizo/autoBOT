Discord Security: A security incident on Discord was quickly addressed. The server owner account was not compromised, and additional security measures are being implemented to prevent future occurrences.

Autopilot Launch: Autopilot has exceeded expectations, reaching nearly $31 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) across the three Autopools in less than two weeks since launch.

Base Deployment: Autopilot on Base chain is scheduled for deployment next week, with a warm-up period before going fully live to the public. As part of the Base deployment a new DEX, Aerodrome, will also be integrated.

Tokenomics Update: New tokenomics are coming soon, allowing users to vote their TOKE tokens to specific Autopools and earn receipt tokens of that Autopool as rewards.

Stablecoin Expansion: The team is focusing on USD-denominated Autopools (autoUSD) as the next major area for expansion.

Podcast Feature: A podcast featuring the team is set to release early next week on The Edge Pod.

Temporary NAV fluctuations: The team explained that temporary fluctuations in Net Asset Value (NAV) below 1 are due to bootstrapping costs and will stabilize as yield accrues.

Incentives Campaign: The incentives campaign is being reviewed on a monthly basis, based on Inflows and LP behavior. Any changes to this will be announced in Discord.

Balancer Integration: A new pool on Balancer pairing balETH with wstETH is being created with incentives expected in October. This marks the first DeFi integration using an Autopool receipt token.

NFT Mint: A snapshot for an upcoming NFT mint will be taken on September 30th for users in the pools.

Future Outlook: The team emphasized that this is just the beginning, with plans to expand and continuously improve the protocol, including targeting USD denominated Autopools to increase attractiveness throughout market cycles.
