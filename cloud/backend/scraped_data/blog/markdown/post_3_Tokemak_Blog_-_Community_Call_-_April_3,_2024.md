Guarded Launch Roadmap Update: The Autopilot guarded launch is progressing well, with rebalances performing as expected through various test scenarios. $AURA is planned to be integrated as an incentive token as early as next week to enable the upcoming integration of Balancer and Aura destinations. A reminder that the performance metrics during this phase may not fully reflect the eventual capability of Autopilot due to the limited and forced nature of the testing scenarios.
Testing Pools Expansion: Preparations are underway to support a broader range of tokens by expanding pricing sources through Redstone and Chainlink oracles. This expansion will enable support for most tokens relevant to liquid staking and restaking on EigenLayer.
Development and Security Testing: The project is currently engaged with Hexens for a comprehensive system audit, with a public announcement expected soon. This rigorous auditing process, involves a significantly larger engineering team than the standard model.
New Features: New additions to the UI will soon be launched including; a Zap in/out feature and the transition of the rebalancing history to an activity feed based on user feedback. A team page will also be added to tokemak.xyz
