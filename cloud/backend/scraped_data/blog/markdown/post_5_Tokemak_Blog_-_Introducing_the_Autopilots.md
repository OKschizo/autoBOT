Introducing: the Autopilots
It’s basically-free JPEG time. Mint is live for OGs on Base. Read more below: 

‍

From the beginning the team has always made an effort to inject interesting aesthetics into our user experience and craft a universe around the protocol – with Autopilot we’re doubling down on this. 

‍

“But why an NFT - they’re worthless rn?”        

‍

Because we still think NFTs are cool, regardless of floor prices. The rise of NFTs was a massive amount of fun and an important addition to onchain culture, and participants in that era should be proud of their accomplishments. If nothing else NFTs brought hundreds of thousands of people onchain and that alone is a major contribution to Ethereum that no one can ever take away.

‍

‍

So here you go, come get your basically free, cool, commemorative and lore-based PFP. Equip it proudly to rep the Tokemak community, after all – DeFi and NFT culture are brothers.

‍

Mint for OGs is live now at: autopilots.tokemak.xyz

‍

Autopilot (launching September 16th) is a useful tool for all ETH holders, especially those that may be mainly in the NFT world who aren’t keeping up with the latest opportunities for their ETH stack. Keeping track of DeFi has become a full time job, and Autopilot’s role as an LP aggregator is to automate that for everyone.

‍

We’ve talked for a while about making a community NFT mint, but didn’t want to do it unless it was worthy of existence. Our new universe is a parable for Tokemak itself, you are the Autopilots and they are the protagonists, in the next ten days we will be revealing more about this world. We hope you like the NFTs, and who knows, maybe your Autopilot will be featured in one of our little videos down the road…

Mint details: 

‍

The mint (on Base) will happen in phases. Each phase will allow for up to 2 mints per category, per wallet. All mints are first come, first served. There will be a tiny 0.0003 ETH fee per mint, in addition to the extremely minimal gas costs on Base. 

‍

Phase 1 - Visionary (143 Mints):

‍

OG $TOKE holders and $accTOKE stakers will be able to mint starting now. The snapshot for this phase was taken on 09.3.2024

‍

Phase 2 - Quickdraw (173 Mints): 

‍

This phase is for any depositors of any amount of ETH into one of the first Autopools (autoETH or autoLRT) at the launch of Autopilot (Sept 16th). The snapshot for depositors will be taken two weeks after launch (Sept 30th). 

‍

Phase 3 - Certified Autopilot (183 Mints): 

‍

Deposit at least 1 ETH into the autoETH or autoLRT pools after the launch of Autopilot. Snapshot will be taken two weeks after launch (Sept 30th). 

‍

Phase 4 - Balancer (balETH Autopool - 70 Mints)

‍

Deposit any amount into the balETH Autopool. Snapshot will be two weeks after the launch of the balETH Autopool (launch date TBA soon). Mints are first come, first served after the snapshot.

‍

More to come... 

‍

We tried to make the mint experience a unique one, so we hope you take the time to check it out, and if you miss the mint, you can always right click and save them.
