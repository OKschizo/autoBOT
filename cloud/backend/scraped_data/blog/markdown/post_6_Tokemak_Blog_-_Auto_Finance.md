Tokemak is now Auto Finance 

A year ago Tokemak reinvented itself as Tokemak Autopilot, or Autopilot for short, the first fully automated liquidity manager. Autopilot aggregates core DeFi primitives into autopools, which optimize yield for LPs and provide a 24/7 responsive source of liquidity for DeFi protocols.  Autopilot gives users a simple approach to access and optimize all forms of yield available to DeFi, including decentralised exchanges, money markets, yield marketplaces, US Treasuries, and funding rates. We sourced and consolidated TVL into one of the largest and best performing LPs in DeFi. 

‍

A year after the launch of Autopilot, we are in a very strong position.  Tokemak now has over $130M in assets under management (AUM) across 12 autopools, demonstrating clear product market fit.  Our TVL is comprised of ETH and stablecoins which are at work in the autopools, currently yielding up to 16.4% on stablecoins and 4.2% on ETH.

‍

Tokemak’s treasury is currently valued at ~$30M as of the time of this article.  As it stands, this treasury value is higher than the current fully diluted value of the TOKE token.  A buyback program is in place to purchase TOKE using protocol revenue, as well as TOKE purchased using some of the accrued altcoins held in our treasury.  

‍

Tokemak's vision of becoming the core liquidity infrastructure for DeFi is now a reality, and the brand must evolve with our platform's evolution. Our efforts are now unified under the banner of Auto Finance.

‍

Auto Finance

Auto Finance directly describes what we do: automate onchain finance. Specifically, it reflects a commitment to developing fully automated liquidity solutions for individual and institutional users alike.The brand enables a cohesive parent identity that evokes what we do and will unify all future product lines under development.

‍

Expanding our portfolio of products

‍

As DeFi and fintech converge, we are evolving to meet the needs of institutional and non crypto-native users, expanding our addressable market and available TVL. Within Auto Finance, we are actively working on the following product lines:

‍

Auto Pools

Core automated vault infrastructure for seamless liquidity management
Auto Pro

Institutional arm, a tailored product offering for professional investors. This enables autopools to be whitelabeled for exchanges, custodians, and funds
Auto App (working title)

Mobile app with integrated fiat on/off-ramps and a simplified UX for easy access to Auto Finance products.  Users can simply connect their bank accounts and access AUTO yields, without the complexity of DeFi
Auto Token

TOKE will migrate 1:1 into AUTO in the near future.  AUTO holders are eligible for protocol revenues and governance over the protocol.
New Yield Product

Upcoming stealth product with details TBA.

‍

Auto Finance’s autopools remain available for use today at tokemak.xyz, with a pop up to greet users and communicate the rebrand for some time.  Auto Pro is open to exchanges, custodians, funds, and other institutions today – reach out at institutions@auto.finance if you’re interested in automated yield for your ETH or stablecoin holdings.  The Auto App and AUTO token will both be launching very soon.

‍

TOKE migration to new AUTO token

‍

The protocol token of Tokemak has always been TOKE and, for now, the protocol token of Auto Finance remains TOKE.  In the near future Auto Finance will be consolidating value across all product lines under a single token: AUTO. 

‍

Key details of the AUTO token include:

1:1 Migration: TOKE tokens will transition to AUTO at a 1:1 ratio, ensuring a seamless process for holders.
Unified Ecosystem: AUTO will be tied to all AUTO products and consolidate all accrued value.
Protocol Revenues: AUTO earns revenues generated from the protocol.  Today, TOKE also earns revenue before it migrates to AUTO.  Therefore, AUTO (and TOKE at this moment in time) gives holders exposure to DeFi yields generated across decentralised exchanges, money markets, US Treasuries, and funding rates.  Current TOKE holders that stake through the site are earning up to 18% APR.  Additional buybacks of TOKE will be commencing imminently, with a portion of the treasury used to buy TOKE.

IMPORTANT: AUTO is not yet launched. Any current AUTO tokens including potential newly created ones are not ours. Trust that we will be very loud when our AUTO token debuts. The launch date of the AUTO token will be announced first on our social channels (discord.gg/tokemak and https://x.com/autopools), with advanced notice.  If you see any other AUTO tokens launching before that, they are NOT affiliated with us, and additionally could be scams. Always check your URLs and your transaction details to protect yourself from phishing attempts.

‍

If you wish to have exposure to Auto Finance in the interim, holding TOKE is the way to do it, as TOKE will seamlessly migrate into AUTO in the near future. Again, 1 TOKE = 1 AUTO post-migration. There will be a simple, streamlined process for TOKE holders to migrate their tokens into AUTO at a 1:1 rate upon launch of AUTO.

‍

New Link Tree

‍

Users can now follow Auto Finance on Twitter/ X with the handle @autopools .  Starting in 1 week, Auto Finance will be hosted at www.auto.finance.  If you’re used to going to tokemak.xyz - fear not, it will always continue to redirect to auto.finance.  

‍

The new Linktree and nomenclature use 'Auto Finance' as the umbrella term for all products and consolidate the Tokemak Autopilot dApp into the term that captures the most user mindshare: ‘Auto Pools’.

‍

Next Steps

Auto Finance will share many announcements soon, with the releases of new product lines and the AUTO token launch and migration planned soon in 2025. Stay tuned for product and governance details!
