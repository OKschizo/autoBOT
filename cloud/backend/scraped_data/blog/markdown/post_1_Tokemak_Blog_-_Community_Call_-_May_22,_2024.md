## Content

Gitbook V2 release: Great progress is being made on the Gitbook V2 documentation, with the aim to have everything ready before the open launch. The new version will include all Autopilot technical documentation, complete with GIFs to demonstrate how to use and navigate the UI.
Audit updates & contract redeployments: The second weekly check-in with Hexens has been completed, with no major issues found so far. Since the start of the guarded launch, numerous updates have been made, leading to a full redeployment of contracts on mainnet. While these contracts are not yet in use, they will be switched over in the coming weeks. All funds will be migrated, with potential for new destinations to be added as part of the transition.
Tokemak Autopilot will be on Base: The Base deployment is expected within a week or so, utilizing CCIP from Chainlink to communicate the data required for Autopilot to operate and rebalance.
Pre-launch marketing: Work has begun on creating timelines for content and campaigns, organizing assets, and planning an NFT campaign to be launched on Base. Coordination of launch media coverage and co-marketing efforts with integrated protocols is also underway. Additional content will include podcasts for educational distribution, YouTube explainers, and research articles.
Splash page updates: The splash page has been updated to more clearly communicate the value of Autopilot to individual users based on feedback from investors and the community.
An invitation to engage: We invite everyone to request a call with the team to discuss Autopilot or provide feedback on the new splash page. If you have some thoughts, please get in touch via Discord!
