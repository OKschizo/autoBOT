Depositing into an Autopool
Browse to the "Autopools" section to select an autopool and view additional details by clicking on it. Once you are ready, use the dialog box to deposit into the autopool:
If your wallet is not connected to tokemak.xyz, or you need to connect to a different network for this autopool, the main button of the dialog will prompt you to do so by clicking it.
Select the asset and amount you wish to deposit. You can deposit any asset, which will subsequently be swapped into the base asset of the autopool (e.g. , ETH). 
You can select a specific slippage tolerance for the swap and deposit by clicking the cog icon.
Setting the "Auto-Stake" toggle to "on" will add the transactions to stake the receipt token to the deposit transaction. If left in the "off" position, you will receive the receipt tokens into your wallet. These can always be staked at a later point.
Click "Deposit" in order to start the deposit process. Note that the first deposit of an asset will require an additional approval transaction.
Withdrawing from the Autopool
Autopool deposits are not subject to lock-ups or cool-down periods, meaning you can withdraw your assets at any time. You can start the process by either clicking "Manage" in the autopools of the "Portfolio" section, or by selecting the autopool from the list in the "Autopools" section.
Select the "Withdraw" tab of the dialog.
Select the amount you wish to to withdraw and the asset you want to receive. You can withdraw as any asset; the system will make the swap for you. You can select a specific slippage tolerance for the withdrawal and swap by clicking the cog icon.
Click "Withdraw" to start the withdrawal process.
