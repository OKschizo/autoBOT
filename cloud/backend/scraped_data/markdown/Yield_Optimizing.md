How the Autopool Protocol Optimizes Across Destinations for Better Yield
Each
autopool
has a pre‑selected
set of eligible destinations
(these can be DEXs, lending protocols, and soon yield markets). The rebalance logic scores those options using a blended view of return
and
cost—headline APRs, fees, rewards, available liquidity, and the “hidden” stuff like volatility and potential impermanent loss.
Instead of chasing whatever advertises the highest APY today, the logic aims to
beat any single venue over time
on a risk‑aware basis.
The goal is steady, risk‑aware outperformance, not whiplash‑inducing APY chasing.
FAQs
How are destinations chosen?
They’re curated for fit (asset type, liquidity depth, integrations, historical behavior) and continuously reviewed.
Do you add new destinations?
On occasion, when they meet safety and strategy criteria. Generally only battle tested destinations are chosen.
More autopools are continually being added, so check back frequently.
