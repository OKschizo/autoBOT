A New Way to LP
The Auto Pools protocol, a novel LP Aggregator, unlocks a new way to LP through automated yield optimization.
Users deposit assets into an autopool, each representing a set of potential deployment destinations for the autonomous rebalance logic.
From there, the Autopool Rebalance Logic takes over, autonomously monitoring the underlying pools and leveraging its powerful framework to rebalance â€“ thus abstracting the complexity associated with rebalancing, compounding, and staking of LP tokens away from the user.

The autopool receipt tokens (e.g., autoETH) are yield-bearing and can be seamlessly integrated across DeFi.
Effortless Access to LP Optimization
The user experience is simple:
LP chooses an autopool, deposit any asset via a simple, gas-optimized transaction and gets back the yield-bearing receipt token (e.g. autoETH)
The autopool monitors the underlying destinations and rebalances
Rewards auto-compound back into the autopool
LP uses Dashboard to keep track of the autopool's performance and other metrics
Providing liquidity to a set of destinations becomes as simple as swapping tokens or making a simple deposit.
"What DEX aggregators did for traders, autopools are doing for LPs."
