What Are Incentives and How Are They Calculated?
Autopool LPs who stake their  receipt tokens currently receive additional TOKE rewards, allocated every two weeks. A defined amount of TOKE is distributed pro rata among LPs, based on the total percentage of the total staked receipt tokens they represent.
The amount of rewards and the split across the different pools is subject to change.
How Do I Claim and Manage My Incentives?
Navigate to your Portfolio and locate the "Autopools" section. Under "Rewards," click "Claim" to initiate the claim process. During this process, you can choose either to compound your TOKE incentives to earn autoETH or to claim liquid TOKE directly to your wallet.
Compound Claim
Compound Claim will lock your claimed TOKE for four weeks, earning additional autoETH receipt tokens. These tokens are the same as the LP receipt tokens you receive for depositing into the autoETH autopool.

Basic Claim
Basic Claim allows you to claim liquid TOKE directly to your wallet. Liquid TOKE can, for example, be used to provide liquidity to the TOKE/ETH pools on SushiSwap or Curve.
