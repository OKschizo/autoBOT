---

Providing liquidity to a TOKE/ETH liquidity pool means depositing both TOKE and ETH into the pool to facilitate trading between them on a decentralized exchange (DEX). In return, you earn a share of the trading fees and may receive additional incentives.

Liquidity pools are available on SushiSwap and Curve v2. While liquidity is provided outside of tokemak.xyz, you can find links to the pools and basic info on these LP positions under the TOKE/ETH LP tab.e
