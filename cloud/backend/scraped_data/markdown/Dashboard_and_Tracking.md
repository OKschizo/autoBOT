Easy Tracking with the In‑App Dashboard
The dashboard gives you clarity at a glance so you always know
what you own, where it’s deployed, and how it’s doing
—without spelunking through multiple protocols.
What you’ll see:
Current allocation
— your destinations and percentages right now.
Performance
— earned to date and recent changes, net of moves.
One‑click actions
— add more or withdraw whenever you want.
Tip
You can change the denomination of your portfolio where it says "Currency," e.g. show it denominated in USD, ETH, etc.
