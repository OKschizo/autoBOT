How Autopools Auto‑Rebalances Between DeFi Destinations
Autopools spread your deposit across a curated set of pools and protocols (we call these
destinations
) and
adjusts
that mix as conditions change. When a different destination looks better
after
accounting for costs like swaps, the autopool shifts only what makes sense.
What’s happening under the hood:
It continuously
monitors
yield signals and market conditions.
It
compares
potential improvements vs. the cost of moving.
It
moves
only when the expected benefit outweighs the costs.
Autopools mean you're not getting chopped up!
You’re not stuck in yesterday’s “best pool,” and you’re not paying churny fees. Rebalances aim to be
infrequent but meaningful
.
A single deposit, and the autopool takes it from there: monitoring, comparing, and only moving when it's worth it.
FAQs
How often does it rebalance?
Only when the improvement is meaningful net of costs. There’s no fixed cadence; it’s opportunity‑driven.
Will it ever move everything at once?
Usually not; it prefers measured shifts to keep costs and slippage low.
Who pays the transaction costs?
Costs are part of the decision logic—rebalances simply won’t happen unless the expected benefit clears those costs.
